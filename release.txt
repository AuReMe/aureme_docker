Changelog:
	- Reworking padmet and padmet-utils allowing full-python workflow in the future

###VERSION:2.3###
24 September 2019

Changelog:
	Notes: Fixing an error when extracting Orthofinder output, user should remove orthology based out and run it again to get all missed reactions.

	- Fixing error when extracting Orthofinder output, could not add reaction associated to a unique gene
	- Orthofinder command will now run Orthofinder only if no "Orthologues" folder was found
	- Updating aureme sample to add all missed reactions


###VERSION:2.2###
15 July 2019

Changelog:
	Fixing error of draft, could not create a draft if annotation folder was empty
	Fixing error of wiki_pages, wrong args used

###VERSION:2.1###
11 July 2019

Changelog:
	Fixing error of check_input when trying to convert gbk to faa

###VERSION:2.0###
09 July 2019

Changelog:
	- AuReMe 2.0 is not compatible with old AuReMe runs.
	- Makefile and config updated: to run aureme with old data, create a new run folder with 'init' command and copy your inputs

	Nomenclature changed:
		- New nomenclature for Orthofinder compatibility: renaming fasta, genbank and sbml files by organism id belonging to it
			ex: old my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/FAA_model.faa => my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/E_coli.faa
			ex: old my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/metabolic_model.faa => my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/E_coli.sbml
			ex: old my_org/genomic_data/FAA_study.faa => my_org/genomic_data/my_org.faa
			This new feature is required since Orthofinder use multiple fasta file simultaneously, thereby need do distingue different Fasta from models.
		- Orthofinder working directory: orthology_based_reconstruction/orthofinder_wd

	Command changed:
		adding:
			_orthofinder
			orthofinder
			which_db: check the database used in a sbml file. Usefull before merging metabolic networks, if different database used, need to map to one unique database with sbml_mapping
				cmd="which_db SBML=*sbml filename without extension, placed in networks/*"
				output: log info: (ex: Best matching database: kegg, {'Unknown': 42, 'total_reaction': 649, 'kegg': 607})
			sbml_mapping: For a sbml, create a dictionnary of reactions ids from the source database to a target one.
				cmd="sbml_mapping SBML=*sbml filename without extension, placed in networks/* DB=*database output in ['metacyc','bigg','kegg']"
				output: csv file, col1 = original id, col2 = db target id. File name = sbml filename + "_dict.csv"
		Removing:
			shogen
			pantograph
			omcl
			Inparanoid
	
	Tools changed:
		- Removing Pantograph, OMCL, Inparanoid
		- Adding Orthofinder 2.3.3 as new tool for Orthology based reconstruction

	Database changed:
		- Updating MetaNetx 2017 to version 2018, set as default.
		- Updating Metacyc 20.5/22.0 to version 23.0, set as default.
		- Updating bigg 1.3 to version 1.5, set as default.

	Bug fix:
		- No longuer required to convert sbml 3 to 2 for input, was only necessary for Pantograph
		- Update: padmet to 3.2
			- Fix sbml id decoding
		- Update: padmet-utils (doc fix, new archi, script cleanning)
			- convert_sbml_db rework
			- wikiGenerator rework
			- pgdb_to_padmet rework
			- Fix of genes association parsing of sbml (Critical error)
			- Fix sbml mapping
			- pgdb to padmet take in account enzymatic complex
			- GBK to FAA take in account isoforms
