###VERSION:2.0###
08 July 2018

Changelog:
	- AuReMe 2.0 is not compatible with old AuReMe runs.
	- Makefile and config updated: to run aureme with old data, create a new run folder with 'init' command and copy your inputs

	Nomenclature changed:
		- New nomenclature for Orthofinder compatibility: renaming fasta, genbank and sbml files by organism id belonging to it
			ex: old my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/FAA_model.faa => my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/E_coli.faa
			ex: old my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/metabolic_model.faa => my_org/orthology_based_reconstruction/E_coli/E_coli.sbml
			ex: old my_org/genomic_data/FAA_study.faa => my_org/genomic_data/my_org.faa
			This new feature is required since Orthofinder use multiple fasta file simultaneously, thereby need do distingue different Fasta from models.
		- Orthofinder working directory: orthology_based_reconstruction/orthofinder_wd

	Command changed:
		adding:
			_orthofinder
			orthofinder
			which_db: check the database used in a sbml file. Usefull before merging metabolic networks, if different database used, need to map to one unique database with sbml_mapping
				cmd="which_db SBML=*sbml filename without extension, placed in networks/*"
				output: log info: (ex: Best matching database: kegg, {'Unknown': 42, 'total_reaction': 649, 'kegg': 607})
			sbml_mapping: For a sbml, create a dictionnary of reactions ids from the source database to a target one.
				cmd="sbml_mapping SBML=*sbml filename without extension, placed in networks/* DB=*database output in ['metacyc','bigg','kegg']"
				output: csv file, col1 = original id, col2 = db target id. File name = sbml filename + "_dict.csv"
		Removing:
			shogen
			pantograph
			omcl
			Inparanoid
