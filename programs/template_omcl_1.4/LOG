V1.4                                         October 2, 2006
    A bug present in all previous releases is fixed in this
    version. This bug is associated with adding co-orthologs
    edges in the graph construction step, but the effect is 
    minor enough to be ignored.
    At the same time, NCBI-BLAST output format m8 is
    incorporated for large-scale clustering and disk saving.
    Thanks to Erich Schwardz, Robson Francisco de Souza, and
    lots of others for suggestions and bug reports. Mode 4 
    is still recommended for large-scale analysis, when 
    users can program their own parser producing BPO file.
